# About the CPP Module 08 project

## Summary
The goal of the CPP Module projects is to get familiar with C++ programming language quickly.
This project specifically focuses on `templated containers`, `iterators` and `algorithms`.

>**Allowed:** Any function from the standard library. If there is a C++ version of a function, use that. The code must compile with C++98.
>
>**Forbidden:** Any function from external libraries, as well as `*printf()`, `*alloc()` and `free()`.
