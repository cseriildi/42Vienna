# About the CPP Module 07 project

## Summary
The goal of the CPP Module projects is to get familiar with C++ programming language quickly. To learn about Templates.
- **Allowed functions**: Any function from the standard library, if there is a C++ version of the function, use that. The code must compile with c++98.
- **Forbidden functions**: Any function from external libraries and `*printf()`, `*alloc()` and `free()`. Namespace and friend keyword. `Containers` (vector/list/map/...) and `Algorithms` (functions from the `algorithm` header).
