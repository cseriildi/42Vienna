# About the CPP Module 05 project

## Summary
The goal of the CPP Module projects is to get familiar with C++ programming language quickly. 
This project specifically focuses on `exceptions`.

>**Allowed:** Any function from the standard library. If there is a C++ version of a function, use that. The code must compile with C++98.
>
>**Forbidden:** Any function from external libraries, as well as `*printf()`, `*alloc()` and `free()`. Containers (`vector`, `list`, `map`, ...) and algorithms (functions from the `algorithm` header).
