          In the early days of the web, HTML was introduced as a simple way to
          structure documents. Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993, HTML allowed
          researchers to share information using hyperlinks, a revolutionary
          idea at the time. Over the years, it evolved from basic tags like
          &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; to a robust standard that supports audio,
          video, and interactive forms, thanks to HTML5.

          One fun fact about early websites is that many were hand-coded in
          Notepad, with blinking text and background music considered
          cutting-edge design. Also, the &lt;marquee&gt; tag, now obsolete, was
          once wildly popular for making text scroll across the screen.

            <a href="https://info.cern.ch/">CERN</a>, and itâ€™s a simple page
            explaining what the World Wide Web is.
